# JengaCase
## A Unity (2021.3.13f1) assessment project that combines math learning domains and Jenga physics
Three towers are constructed from an API that contains mastery information of several math learning domain types in grades 6, 7, 8.
These mastery types indicate the type of blocks that are spawned (Stone, Wood, Glass), so that Jenga wobble can be applied to investigate the gaps in students' learning.
Includes three towers, camera controls (Mouse 1 to rotate, arrow keys to focus tower), a movable UI window, a bit of a background environment, and tweaked physics settings.
